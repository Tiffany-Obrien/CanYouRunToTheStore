## About

Using the MERN stack, we created an application where users can log in and create their lists, then add items and notes before deleting the items one by one as they shop. Users can also update their lists on the go, changing items and revising notes to ensure the right products are being bought for the household, which is especially important considering the rising costs of consumer goods.

Although we did not achieve full functionality on this project, with a small break to reflect on what we've learned throughout our course, we believe we can truly achieve our original development goals.

## User Story
